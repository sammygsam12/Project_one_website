I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  This assignment was so tedious and so much work! I felt like I
understood really well how to write the HTML but getting it uploaded to github to get it to 
netfly was so difficult! Further tutorials on how to do that part would be great!

    <h2>Perfect Pot Poem:</h2>
        <p>My favorite animal is a bee. Here is a haiku. 
        </p>
        <p align = "center">
            <br>
            Windy afternoon
            <br>
            An intelligent bee snorts
            <br>
            at the perfect pot
            <br>
        </p>
    <h2>My favorite videogames:</h2>
        <p> Some of my favorite hobbies involve videogames. 
            I really enjoy playing videogames with my brothers. 
            One of my favorite videogames is League of Legends.
        </p>
        <p> The biggest reason I like to play League of Legends is beccause I am very good at it.
            There are a variety of roles that you can play in League of Legends.
            My favorite role to play is called an "attack damage carry" or "ADC"
        </p>
        <p> While I was in high school, I would play for long period of time.
            my average day playing was around 8-9 hours a day.
            Luckily, I do not have that kind of time now to play because of school and work.
